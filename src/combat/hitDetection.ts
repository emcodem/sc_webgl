// at pos alone would let rounds tunnel clean through a target between steps at that speed, so we

// hull, and for a hit on the PLAYER's own ship, the pilot camera sits at that same center in
// first-person view, so a near-center impact origin puts the spark burst essentially on top of the
// camera — which blew the GPU spark shader's perspective size scaling out to cover the whole screen
